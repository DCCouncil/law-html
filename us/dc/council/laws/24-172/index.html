                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(B)</span> The conduct was directed toward a person other than the complainant;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(C)</span> The complainant submitted to or participated in the conduct;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(D)</span> The complainant was able to complete employment responsibilities despite the conduct;</p>
