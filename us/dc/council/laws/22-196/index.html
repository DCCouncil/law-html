                <p class="text--italic">To repeal the Initiative No. 77 – Minimum Wage Amendment Act of 2018; to require the Mayor to create an easily accessible Internet website that describes the various District wage-and-hour and anti-discrimination laws, to launch a public-education campaign to raise awareness and educate the public about the rights of tipped workers, and to create and staff a tip-violation line to receive complaints specifically related to wage laws in the District; to amend the Service Improvement and Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Support Act of 1999 to require the Office of Human Rights to provide a sexual-harassment training course for employees of businesses that employ tipped workers or to allow the Office of Human Rights to certify a list of providers who may provide such training; to amend the Minimum Wage Act Revision Act of 1992 to require employers who employ tipped workers to provide their employees with a tip-out sheet each pay period and to use a third-party to prepare payroll, to require the third-party payroll preparer to report certain wage data on a quarterly basis, including the employer's tip-out policy, to the Department of Employment Services, to require the tip portal operated by the Mayor to be user-friendly to enable an employee to report easily to the Director of the Department of Employment Services an alleged wage-theft violation and to accept the submission of electronic spreadsheets with wage information instead of requiring the manual entry of such data, and to create the Tipped Workers Coordinating Council; and to amend An Act To provide for the payment and collection of wages in the District of Columbia to require that business owners or operators who employ tipped workers attend, at least once annually, training on the requirements of the District's wage-theft law, that managers who are employed by an employer that employs tipped workers attend, at least once annually, an in-person training on the requirements of the District's wage-theft law, that employers of tipped workers provide employees with the opportunity to attend training on the requirements of the District's wage-theft law, and that employers of tipped workers annually certify to the Department of Employment Services that such training requirements have been met.</p>
                <p>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Tipped Wage Workers Fairness Amendment Act of 2018".</p>
