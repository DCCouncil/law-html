The Mayor may provide subsidies to a developer, as necessary, to ensure that the affordable-housing requirements imposed by this subsection are met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote">"<span class="level-num">(4)</span> The Mayor may waive the affordable-housing requirements of this subsection; provided, the Mayor certifies that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(A)</span> The appraised value of the property to be disposed of is insufficient to support the affordable-housing requirements, taking into account all other available sources of public funding for affordable housing, whether provided by the District of Columbia or the federal government;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(B)</span> The terms and conditions under which the real property is to be disposed of satisfy the affordable-housing requirements to the maximum extent possible; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(C)</span> The Chief Financial Officer has provided to the Mayor and the Council a financial analysis that shall consist of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 quote">"<span class="level-num">(i)</span> A review and analysis of the financial condition of disposed-of land; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 quote">"<span class="level-num">(ii)</span> An advisory opinion stating whether or not it is likely that the developer reasonably could be expected to satisfy the affordable-housing requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote">"<span class="level-num">(5)</span> Paragraph (4) of this subsection shall not apply to the disposition of the building and property owned by the District and located at 425 2nd Street, N.W., unless the District commits to using all of the proceeds from the disposition of the property for the construction of one or more new homeless shelters and affordable housing to serve a homeless population of comparable size to the homeless population at 425 2nd Street, N.W.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote">"<span class="level-num">(6)</span> The Mayor may reduce the affordable-housing requirements of this section if the proposed disposition of real property finances the development of a significant public facility.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "public facility" means a building, structure, or system that is an asset of the District government eligible for capital spending and subject to depreciation.  A public facility may include a fire station, public library, public school, stadium, or homeless shelter.  Notwithstanding the priority to finance a significant public facility, the Mayor shall nevertheless endeavor to provide affordable housing, consistent with this section, to the extent economically feasible.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote">"<span class="level-num">(7)</span> Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the Mayor may waive the affordable-housing requirements of this subsection if the District-owned real property is less than 5,000 square feet, even though the property may be consolidated with a private development of multifamily housing consisting of 10 or more units.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote">"<span class="level-num">(b-4)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If a substantive change is made to the business terms of the transaction described in the term sheet or Memorandum of Understanding, referenced in subsection (b-1)(2) of this section, after the resolution was transmitted to and approved by the Council pursuant to this section, a proposed resolution describing the change and accompanied by the amended documents in redline format shall be transmitted to Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess.  If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed amendments to the documents, in whole or in part, by resolution within the 45-day review period, the proposed amendments shall be deemed approved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote">"<span class="level-num">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote">"<span class="level-num">(A)</span> "Redline format" means the changes that are deletions have a line through them and the changes that are additions are underlined.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(g)">(g)</span> Subsection (d) is amended to read as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote">"<span class="level-num">(d)</span> Approval of the disposition of the real property by the Council shall expire 2 years after the effective date of the resolution of approval.  If the Mayor determines subsequent to Council approval that the property cannot be disposed of within the 2-year period, the Mayor may submit to the Council a resolution to extend the time for the disposition of the property, and shall include with the transmittal a detailed status report on efforts made toward disposition of the property as well as the reasons for the inability to dispose of the property within the 2-year period.  The resolution may extend the time for any specified period up to 2 years.  If the Council does not take action to approve or disapprove the resolution within 45 days of receipt of the resolution, not including Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, or days of Council recess, the resolution shall be deemed disapproved.".</p>

                <p>The Council adopts the fiscal impact statement in the committee report as the fiscal impact statement required by section 4a of the General Legislative Procedures Act of 1975, approved October 16, 2006 (120 Stat. 2038; D.C. Official Code § 1-301.47a).</p>
