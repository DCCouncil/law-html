The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer’s liquidity or solvency.</p>
