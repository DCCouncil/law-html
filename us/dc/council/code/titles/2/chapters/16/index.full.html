Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11" title="§ 1–207.11. Abolishment of existing government and transfer of functions.">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia.

Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14#(a)" title="">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
