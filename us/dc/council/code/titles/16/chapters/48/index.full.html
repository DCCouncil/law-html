                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/dc/council/code/sections/16-4801#(1)">(1)</span> Existing custody law does not provide adequately for the needs of a parent who is terminally ill, who is periodically incapable of caring for the needs of a child due to the parent's incapacity or debilitation resulting from illness, or who may be subject to an adverse immigration action, and who desires to make long-term plans for the future of a child without terminating or limiting in any way the parent’s legal rights.</p>
