                  <p>Although Law 18-341 did not contain a provision requiring that the fiscal effect of Law 18-341 be included in an approved budget and financial plan in order for Law 18-341 to apply as law, the Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of February 15, 2012, that the fiscal effect of Law 18-341 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 18-341, are not in effect.</p>
