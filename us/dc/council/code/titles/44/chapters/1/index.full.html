                <p>The purpose of this chapter is to set uniform, minimum standards of licensure for community residence facilities currently regulated under Chapter 34 of Title 22 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations and other facilities when they provide services that assist residents with the activities of daily living. This chapter creates a new category of licensure called “assisted living residence”.</p>

The function of an assisted living residence is to provide or coordinate personalized assistance through activities of daily living, recreational activities, 24-hour supervision, and provision or coordination of health services and instrumental activities of daily living as needed.</p>
