This presumption shall not apply to individuals or families seeking shelter for reasons of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking. Additionally, this presumption shall not affect an individual's or family's eligibility for crisis intervention services, including family mediation, conflict resolution, or other family stabilization services.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1B)">(1B)</span> Intake workers shall provide the following for each individual seeking services:</p>
