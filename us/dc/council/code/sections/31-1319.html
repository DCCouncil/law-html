No other committee of any nature shall be appointed by the Commissioner or the court in liquidation proceedings conducted under this chapter;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(12)">(12)</span> To borrow money on the security of the insurer’s assets or without security and to execute and deliver all documents necessary to that transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation.

A waiver of any defense by the insurer after a petition in liquidation has been filed shall not bind the liquidator.
