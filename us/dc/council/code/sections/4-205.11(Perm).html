                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> In determining the need of families who are applying for or receiving TANF:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Deduct such amount for a work-related expense as the Mayor shall specify through rulemaking. If the individual is self-employed, work expenses directly related to producing the goods or services, and without which the goods or services could not be produced, shall be excluded from the gross earned income total;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Deduct the cost of care of each dependent child, or care of an incapacitated adult living in the same home and receiving TANF or POWER, up to a maximum amount that the Mayor shall specify through rulemaking. The maximum amount deductible for the cost of care of a child may vary depending upon the age of the child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> For initial applicants, determine whether the monthly income, after disregards allowed under paragraph (1) or (2) of this section, exceeds the standard of assistance. If so, the family is ineligible for assistance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Disregard all of the monthly gross earned income of each child receiving TANF if the child is a full-time student, or is a part-time student provided he is not employed full time.

The Mayor shall establish, through rulemaking, the amount and/or percentage of earned income to be disregarded, the period of time during which any earned income may be disregarded, and other rules necessary to implement this provision. The rules shall reflect the District’s interests in rewarding work, assisting needy families, and promoting self-sufficiency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4A)(B)">(B)</span> To the extent permitted under federal law, in calculating the eligibility for Medicaid (other than Transitional Medicaid) of a child or a family with minor children, the Mayor shall disregard earned income to the same extent that earned income is disregarded under TANF. In calculating eligibility for Transitional Medicaid, subject to the approval of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Mayor shall disregard income for the first 12 months of Transitional Medicaid pursuant to the provisions established in § 1925(a) of the Social Security Act, approved October 13, 1988 (102 Stat. 2385; 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-6(a)), and shall disregard income for the second 12 months of Transitional Medicaid pursuant to the provisions established in § 1925(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396r-6(b)). Absent approval by HHS, income shall be disregarded pursuant to applicable federal law.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)(B)">(B)</span> Voluntarily requested assistance be terminated for the sole purpose of evading any time limit placed on the disregarding of earned income that may be established by rule by the Mayor;</p>
