The child, his parent, guardian or custodian may present evidence on the issues and be heard in their own behalf.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> When a judge finds there is probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true, he shall order the child to be placed or continued in detention or shelter care and set forth is reasons.
