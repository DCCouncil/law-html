                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Describes the functions and purpose of the Youth Council;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Explains the process of selection and appointment to the Youth Council; and</p>

In addition, the Youth Council may create other leadership positions as deemed necessary. In its first year of operation, the Chair shall be chosen by the selection committee from among the initial 32 Youth Council members, with the approval of the Mayor. The Chair shall serve for one year. The selection of these 32 members shall be made prior to the Youth Council’s initial retreat. All other officers shall be selected by the Youth Council at their retreat, and shall serve for one year. Thereafter, the Youth Council shall select all officers.
