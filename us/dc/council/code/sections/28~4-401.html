                  <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                  <p>1. An item is properly payable from a customer’s account if the customer has authorized the payment and the payment does not violate any agreement that may exist between the bank and its customer. For an example of a payment held to violate an agreement with a customer, see  Torrance National Bank v. Enesco Federal Credit Union, 285 P.2d 737 (Cal.App.1955). An item drawn for more than the amount of a customer’s account may be properly payable. Thus under subsection (a) a bank may charge the customer’s account for an item even though payment results in an overdraft. An item containing a forged drawer’s signature or forged indorsement is not properly payable. Concern has arisen whether a bank may require a customer to execute a stop-payment order when the customer notifies the bank of the loss of an unindorsed or specially indorsed check. Since such a check cannot be properly payable from the customer’s account, it is inappropriate for a bank to require stop-payment order in such a case.</p>
                  <p>2. Subsection (b) adopts the view of case authority holding that if there is more than one customer who can draw on an account, the nonsigning customer is not liable for an overdraft unless that person benefits from the proceeds of the item.</p>
                  <p>3. Subsection (c) is added because the automated check collection system cannot accommodate postdated checks. A check is usually paid upon presentment without respect to the date of the check. Under the former law, if a payor bank paid a postdated check before its stated date, it could not charge the customer’s account because the check was not “properly payable.” Hence, the bank might have been liable for wrongfully dishonoring subsequent checks of the drawer that would have been paid had the postdated check not been prematurely paid. Under subsection (c) a customer wishing to postdate a check must notify the payor bank of its postdating in time to allow the bank to act on the customer’s notice before the bank has to commit itself to pay the check. If the bank fails to act on the customer’s timely notice, it may be liable for damages for the resulting loss which may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items. This Act does not regulate fees that banks charge their customers for a notice of postdating or other services covered by the Act, but under principles of law such as unconscionability or good faith and fair dealing, courts have reviewed fees and the bank’s exercise of a discretion to set fees.  Perdue v. Crocker National Bank, 38 Cal.3d 913 (1985) (unconscionability);  Best v. United Bank of Oregon, 739 P.2d 554, 562-566 (1987) (good faith and fair dealing). In addition,  Section 1-203 provides that every contract or duty within this Act imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.</p>
                  <p>4.  Section 3-407(c) states that a payor bank or drawee which pays a fraudulently altered instrument in good faith and without notice of the alteration may enforce rights with respect to the instrument according to its original terms or, in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed.  Section 4-401(d) follows the rule stated in  Section 3-407(c) by applying it to an altered item and allows the bank to enforce rights with respect to the altered item by charging the customer’s account.</p>
                  <p>Reason for 1990 Change [<a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/laws/10-249" title="D.C. Law 10-249. Uniform Commercial Code-Negotiable Instruments Act of 1994.">D.C. Law 10-249</a>]</p>
                  <p>Subsection (a) is amended by the addition of the second sentence which provides a more general definition of “properly payable” than the narrow definition that was contained in former  Section 4-104(1)(i). An item is properly payable from a customer’s account if the customer has authorized the payment and the payment does not violate the customer-bank agreement concerning the account. An item drawn for more than the balance of the customer’s account may be properly payable.</p>
                  <p>Subsection (b) is added to adopt the view of case authority holding that if there is more than one customer who can draw on an account, the nonsigning customer is not liable for an overdraft unless that person benefits from the proceeds of the item.</p>
                  <p>Subsection (c) is added because the automated check collection system cannot accommodate postdated checks. A check is usually paid upon presentment without respect to the date of the check. Under the former law, if a payor bank paid a postdated check before its stated date, it could not charge the customer’s account because the check was not “properly payable.” Hence, the bank might have been liable for wrongfully dishonoring subsequent checks of the drawer that would have been paid had the postdated check not been prematurely paid. Under subsection (c) a customer wishing to postdate a check must notify the payor bank of its postdating in time to allow the bank to act on the customer’s notice before the bank has to commit itself to pay the check. If the bank fails to act on the customer’s timely notice, it may be liable for damages for the resulting loss which may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items.</p>
                  <p>The other modifications are made to conform with current legislative drafting practices, with no intent to change substance.</p>
