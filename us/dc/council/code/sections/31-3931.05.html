                  <p>“(B) Making of an order under this section would achieve the purposes set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>“(2) A liquidation or rehabilitation order may be made with respect to one or more segregated accounts.</p>
                  <p>“(3) A liquidation or rehabilitation order shall direct that the business and segregated account assets of, or attributable to, a segregated account shall be managed by a liquidator or rehabilitator specified in the order for the purpose of:</p>
                  <p>“(A) The orderly closing or rehabilitation of the business of, or attributable to, the segregated account; and</p>
                  <p>“(B) The distribution of the segregated account assets, or assets attributable to the segregated account, to those having recourse thereto.</p>
                  <p>“(d) The liquidator or rehabilitator of a segregated account:</p>
                  <p>“(1) Shall have all the functions and powers of the directors responsible for the business and segregated account assets of, or attributable to, the segregated account;</p>
                  <p>“(2) May at any time apply to the court for directions as to the extent or exercise of any function or power, for the liquidation or rehabilitation order to be discharged or varied, or for an order as to any matter occurring during the course of the liquidation or rehabilitation; and</p>
                  <p>“(3) In exercising his functions and powers, shall be deemed to act as the agent of the captive insurer and shall not incur personal liability except to the extent that he acts fraudulently, recklessly, negligently, or in bad faith.</p>
                  <p>“(e) Upon the filing of a petition for, and during the period of operation of, a liquidation or rehabilitation order:</p>
                  <p>“(1) No proceedings shall be instituted or continued by or against the captive insurer or segregated account in respect of which the liquidation or rehabilitation order was made; and</p>
                  <p>“(2) No steps shall be taken to enforce any security or in the execution of legal process in respect of the business or segregated account assets of or attributable to the segregated account in respect of which the liquidation or rehabilitation order was made, except by leave of the court.</p>
                  <p>“(f)(1) During the period of operation of a liquidation or rehabilitation order:</p>
                  <p>“(A) The functions and powers of the directors shall cease with respect to the business of, or attributable to, the segregated account or segregated account assets for which the order was made; and</p>
                  <p>“(B) The liquidator or rehabilitator of the segregated account shall be entitled to be present at all meetings of the captive insurer or segregated account and to vote at such meetings as if he or she were a director of the captive insurer.</p>
                  <p>“(2) Unless there are no creditors that are entitled to have recourse to the captive insurer’s general assets, the liquidator’s or rehabilitator’s voting authority includes matters concerning the captive insurer’s general assets.</p>
                  <p>“(g)(1) The Court shall not discharge a liquidation or rehabilitation order issued pursuant to this section unless it appears to the Court that the purpose for which the order was made has been achieved, substantially achieved, or is incapable of being achieved.</p>
                  <p>“(2) The Court, on hearing a petition for the discharge or variation of a liquidation or rehabilitation order, may make any interim order or adjourn the proceeding.</p>
                  <p>“(3) Upon the Court issuing an order discharging a liquidation or rehabilitation order for a segregated account on the ground that the purpose for which the order was made had been achieved or substantially achieved, the Court may direct that any payment made by the liquidator or rehabilitator to any creditor of the captive insurer, with respect to that segregated account, shall be full satisfaction of the liabilities of the captive insurer to that creditor with respect to that segregated account, and the creditor’s claims against the captive insurer with respect to that segregated account shall be thereby extinguished.”</p>
