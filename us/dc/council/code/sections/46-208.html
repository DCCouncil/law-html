Attachment and Garnishment.">Chapter 5 of Title 16</a>, where a notice or order to withhold is served on a holder of an obligor’s earnings or other income, the withholding shall be for an amount sufficient to satisfy the obligor’s periodic support obligation, an amount equal to 25% of the periodic support obligation if the obligor owes overdue support, and other costs or fees required by the support order.</p>
                  <p>“(b) When an obligor is no longer subject to a periodic support obligation but owes overdue support, the withholding shall be for the amount of the obligor’s most recent periodic support obligation.</p>
                  <p>“(c) Upon a motion by a party or the IV-D agency, the Court may order withholding of an amount that differs from the amount required for overdue support pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section if the Court finds that the amount required would:</p>
                  <p>“(1) Cause a substantial hardship to the obligor; or</p>
                  <p>“(2) Result in an unreasonable delay in the full payment of the overdue support.</p>

                  <p>“(f) Nothing in this act shall be construed to require a judicial or administrative hearing before the implementation of withholding.</p>
                  <p>“(g) An order to withhold issued in accordance with this act shall be binding on each present and future holder upon whom it is served until the holder is notified of its termination in writing by the Court or the IV-D agency. Upon a motion filed by a party or the IV-D agency, the Court may enforce an order to withhold issued by the IV-D agency in the same manner as the Court may enforce a judicial order, including civil contempt.</p>
