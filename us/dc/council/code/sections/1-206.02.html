                  <h4>Congressional Disapproval of Acts of the Council</h4>
                  <p>
      Congress has utilized its authority under subsection (c) of this section to nullify the following acts of the Council of the District of Columbia:</p>
                  <p>(1) The Location of Chanceries Act of 1979, D.C. Act 3-120, adopted on final reading by the Council October 9, 1979, signed by the Mayor November 9, 1979 ( 26 DCR 2188). Disapproval was effective December 20, 1979.</p>
                  <p>(2) The District of Columbia Sexual Assault Reform Act of 1981, D.C. Act 4-69, adopted on final reading by the Council July 14, 1981, signed by the Mayor July 2, 1981 ( 28 DCR 3409). Disapproval was effective October 1, 1981.</p>
                  <p>(3) The Schedule of Heights Amendment Act of 1990, Act 8-329, adopted on final reading by the Council December 18, 1990, signed by the Mayor December 27, 1990 ( 38 DCR 369). The disapproval was effective on March 21, 1991.</p>
                  <p>(4) The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, D.C. Act 24-789, adopted on final reading by the Council November 15, 2022, vetoed by the Mayor January 3, 2023, veto overridden by the Council January 17, 2023 (70 DCR 1249). Disapproval was effective March 20, 2023.</p>
                  <p>At the time of the disapproval of the first act, section 602(c)(1) of the Home Rule Act required both Houses of Congress to adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving the act. D.C. Act 3-120 was disapproved by both Houses of Congress in S.Con.Res.63 (in Lieu of H.Con.Res.228).</p>
                  <p>D.C. Act 4-69 would have amended titles 22 and 23 of the District of Columbia Code. At the time of the disapproval, section 602(c)(2) provided that either House of Congress could adopt a resolution disapproving an act of the Council that amended or would be codified in titles 22, 23, or 24. D.C. Act 4-69 was disapproved by one House of Congress, the House of Representatives, in H.Res.208.</p>
                  <p>By the time the Council transmitted D.C. Act 8-329 to Congress, the Supreme Court had decided, in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chada, 462 U.S. 919, 103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983), that a provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act that allowed one House of Congress to invalidate a decision of the Executive Branch violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Congress amended the Home Rule Act to conform with the Chada decision. Section 602 was amended to require that in order to disapprove an act of the Council, both Houses of Congress must pass a joint resolution that would then require the signature of the President. D.C. Act 8-329 was disapproved by joint resolution of Congress and signature of the President in Public Law 102-11.</p>
                  <p>D.C. Act 24-789 was disapproved by joint resolution of Congress and signature of the President in Public Law 118-1.</p>
