                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(7)">(7)</span> When the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is revoked, such organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of the order or revocation, to wind up its affairs within the District, and shall conduct no further business within the District except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of such organization within the District. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation whatsoever within the District. The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further operation of the organization as the Commissioner may find to be in the best interest of enrollees, to the end that enrollees will be afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.</p>
