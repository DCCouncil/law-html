                  <p>“Sec. 1637. The incorporation into this code of any general and permanent provision taken from an act making appropriations, or from an act containing other provisions of a private or temporary character, shall not repeal nor in any way affect any appropriation or any provision of a private or temporary character contained in any of said acts, but the same shall remain in force.”</p>
                  <p>“Sec. 1638. The repeal by the preceding section of any statute, in whole or in part, shall not affect any act done or any right accruing or accrued or any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil cause before such repeal, but all rights and liabilities under the statutes or parts thereof so repealed shall continue and may be enforced in the same manner as if such repeal had not been made: Provided, that the provisions of this code relating to procedure or practice and not affecting the substantial rights of parties shall apply to pending suits or proceedings civil or criminal.”</p>

                  <p>“Sec. 1641. All offenses committed and all penalties or forfeitures incurred in the District prior to the date on which this code is to take effect may be prosecuted and punished in the same manner and with the same effect as if this code had not been enacted.”</p>

Where any action or proceeding by the provisions of chapter forty-one of this code would be barred at the time it goes into effect, or within one year thereafter, which would not be so barred by prior laws, such action or proceeding may be brought or instituted within such period of one year, anything in said chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>
                  <p>“Sec. 1643. That nothing herein contained shall be held to affect the term of office of any judicial or other officer holding office when this code goes into effect and operation, except when, as in the case of the present justices of the peace and constables, a contrary intention is manifested.”</p>
