An accommodation would cause an employer undue hardship when it would cause the employer to incur more than de minimis costs.</p>

The mere assumption that other employees with the same religious beliefs might also request accommodation shall not be considered evidence of undue hardship. An employer that employs 5 or fewer full-time employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection.</p>
