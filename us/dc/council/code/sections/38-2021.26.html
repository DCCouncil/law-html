Any nontaxable distribution or portion thereof from a qualified plan may be directly rolled over tax-free to another qualified plan or a plan or annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, if separate accounting and other requirements are met pursuant to section 402(c)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

If a conflict should arise with a qualification requirement, the provision shall be interpreted in favor of maintaining the federal qualification requirements. The District of Columbia Retirement Board may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> “Direct rollover” means a payment to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee described in section 402(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> “Distributee” means a teacher or former teacher. In addition, the teacher’ or former teacher’s surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased teacher is also a distributee for purposes of this section; provided, that, in the case of a nonspouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code that is established on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. The determination of the extent to which a distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be made in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-7, Q&amp;A 17 and 18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> “Eligible retirement plan” means:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)(A)">(A)</span> An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)(C)">(C)</span> A qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)(D)">(D)</span> An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)(E)">(E)</span> An eligible plan described in section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state, that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution and agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such plan from the arrangement described under this part. The foregoing definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> “Eligible rollover distribution,” within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(A)">(A)</span> A distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(B)">(B)</span> A distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. A distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary under section 401(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code is an eligible rollover distribution. A portion of the distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income. However, the portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code or to a qualified trust or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code if the trust or annuity plan or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.</p>

                  <p>“(1) ‘Direct rollover’ means a payment to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee described in  section 402(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                  <p>“(2) ‘Distributee’ means a teacher or former teacher. In addition, the teacher’ or former teacher’s surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased teacher is also a distributee for purposes of this section; provided, that, in the case of a nonspouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity under  section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code that is established on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of  section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. The determination of the extent to which a distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary is required under  section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be made in accordance with  IRS Notice 2007-7, Q 17 and  18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395.</p>
                  <p>“(3) ‘Eligible retirement plan’ means:</p>
                  <p>“(A) An individual retirement account described in  section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, including a Roth IRA described in  section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>
                  <p>“(B) An individual retirement annuity described in  section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, including a Roth IRA described in  section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>
                  <p>“(C) A qualified trust described in  section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an annuity plan described in  section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution;</p>
                  <p>“(D) An annuity contract described in  section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution; and</p>
                  <p>“(E) An eligible plan described in  section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state, that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution and agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such plan from the arrangement described under this act. The foregoing definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order.</p>
                  <p>“(4) ‘Eligible rollover distribution,’ within the meaning of  section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:</p>
                  <p>“(A) A distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; and</p>
                  <p>“(B) A distribution to the extent such distribution is required under  section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. A distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary under  section 401(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code is an eligible rollover distribution. A portion of the distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income. However, the portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code or to a qualified trust or annuity plan described in  section 401(a) or  403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an annuity contract described in  section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code if the trust or annuity plan or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.”</p>
                  <p>Section 4(b) of D.C. Law 19-313 provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
