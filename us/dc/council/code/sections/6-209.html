Revenue bonds and other obligations.">§ 1-204.90</a>, subject to the restrictions of this chapter, the Council delegates to the Authority the power to issue revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations to finance, refinance, or assist in the financing or refinancing of any undertaking of the Authority in the area of housing that is in furtherance, and not inconsistent with, the purposes of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as restricting, impairing, or superseding the authority otherwise vested in the HFA. Each such issuance shall be authorized by a resolution of the Authority and the Authority shall send a copy of the resolution to the Chairman of the Council and the Mayor. The resolution shall describe the nature of the project; the benefits designed to result therefrom, as related to the public purposes of the Authority; and the criteria under which funds will be made available.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Board shall determine, by enactment of an eligibility resolution, that a housing project or homeownership program contemplated to be financed through a bond issuance meets the requirements of this chapter. Subsequent to enactment of an eligibility resolution, the Authority shall send to the Chairman of the Council and the Mayor written notification thereof, describing the nature of the housing project, the benefits designed to result therefrom as related to the public purposes of the Authority, and the criteria under which funds will be made available.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Each notification transmitted to the Chairman of the Council and the Mayor shall set forth information pertaining to the following:</p>

During the Council review period, comments of the Council representative from the affected ward shall be considered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> If, during the 30-day review period, the Council does not adopt a resolution disapproving the proposal, the Authority may take action to implement the proposal. The Council may adopt a resolution approving the proposal prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, in which case the Authority may take immediate action to implement the proposal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> If a proposal is disapproved, the resolution shall state the reasons for disapproval. The Authority staff may modify the proposal to address the concerns expressed in the resolution of disapproval and may, without further action of the Board, resubmit the proposal, as modified, for a 30-day review period, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and days of Council recess. If, during the 30-day review period, the Council does not adopt a resolution disapproving the resubmitted proposal, the Authority may take action to implement the proposal. The Council may adopt a resolution approving the resubmitted proposal prior to the expiration of the 30-day review period, in which case the Authority may take immediate action to implement the proposal.

Whenever expedient, the Authority may refund Obligations, including Obligations previously issued by other than the Authority, by the issuance of new Obligations, regardless of whether or not the Obligations to be refunded have matured.  The Authority may also issue Obligations for a combination of refund, renewal, and financing programs authorized by HUD or this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> The Authority shall have the power to contract with the holders of its Obligations as to the custody, collection, securing, investment, and payment of any monies of the Authority and of any monies held in trust or otherwise for the payment of the Obligations, subject to applicable provisions of federal law regarding a program for which Obligations were issued.</p>
