Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as restricting, impairing, or superseding the authority otherwise vested in the HFA. Each such issuance shall be authorized by a resolution of the Authority and the Authority shall send a copy of the resolution to the Chairman of the Council and the Mayor. The resolution shall describe the nature of the project; the benefits designed to result therefrom, as related to the public purposes of the Authority; and the criteria under which funds will be made available.</p>

Whenever expedient, the Authority may refund Obligations, including Obligations previously issued by other than the Authority, by the issuance of new Obligations, regardless of whether or not the Obligations to be refunded have matured.
