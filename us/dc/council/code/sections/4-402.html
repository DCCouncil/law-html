                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Department is hereby authorized to provide a broad program of day care services for children of parents referred or approved by the Department for various training and work incentive programs, for children of other parents known to the Department where day care appears to be in the child’s best interest, and for children of low-income families, otherwise unknown to the Department, where the parents are employed outside of the home. As a part of its broad program of day care services, the Department shall develop a funding system for all child development facilities serving such children consistent with the provisions of this chapter that will encourage such facilities to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Provide a setting and a comprehensive program for the critically important early childhood development experience that will include, but not necessarily be limited to, educational, social, recreational, transportation, health, and nutritional services;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Provide services directed to the total well-being of the child and the stabilization of the family unit;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Provide a program which incorporates a broad-based parent and community participation component;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Provide a resource to enable parents to join or remain in the work force, participate in job training and to attain self-sufficiency and independence for their families; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> Provide a program which protects children of working parents from neglect or inadequate care.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Department is further authorized to provide supplemental payments to child development facilities licensed pursuant to section 5 of the Child Development Facilities Regulation Act of 1998, effective April 13, 1999 (D.C. Law 12-215; D.C. Official Code § 7-2034), to implement the ECE salary scale. The Department shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Establish and periodically update a child development facilities payroll funding formula through rules issued pursuant to Title I of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act, approved October 21, 1968 (82 Stat. 1204; D.C. Official Code § 2-501 <em>et seq</em>.), which the Department shall use to issue payments from the Early Childhood Educator Pay Equity Fund to licensed child development facilities that enter into contracts or agreements with the Department to implement the minimum salaries provided in the ECE salary scale;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Publish a recommended salary schedule, consistent with the minimum salaries in the ECE salary scale, which shall include pay bands or steps that reflect proposed salary increases based on experience or time-in-position;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Establish requirements for licensed child development facilities to receive CDF payroll formula funds;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> Execute contracts or agreements with licensed child development facility operators to govern Department distribution and facility use and administration of CDF payroll formula funds, which shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)(A)">(A)</span> Be renewed not less than once every 3 years;</p>

The CDF payroll formula shall incorporate the estimated cost for child development facilities to implement the minimum salaries specified in section 11b(b). The publication shall include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The estimated total cost of payments to be made to child development facilities in Fiscal Year 2024;</p>
