The credit provided under this subsection shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this chapter that the amount of the individual's adjusted gross income received by him, or accrued to him if on an accrual basis, subject to tax in the other jurisdiction bears to his entire adjusted gross income received by him, or accrued to him, while he was concurrently a resident of the District. The Mayor may require satisfactory proof of the payment of such income taxes to another jurisdiction. The credit provided by this subsection shall not be allowed against any tax imposed under §§ <u>47-1808.01</u> through <u>47-1808.06</u>. Beginning with any taxable year after December 31, 1990, no franchise tax, license tax, excise tax, unincorporated business tax, occupation tax, or any tax characterized as such by the other taxing jurisdiction, even if applied to earned or business income, shall qualify as a credit under this section.</p>

If more than 1 taxable year begins in such calendar year such amount shall be allowed as a credit against the tax for the last taxable year so beginning.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> If a return is filed for a period of less than a full calendar or fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1988, the credit allowed under this subsection shall be the credit calculated according to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, multiplied times the ratio that the employment-related expenses, allowed under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and incurred during the period of residency in the District, bear to the total employment-related expenses allowed under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and incurred for the whole taxable year.</p>

For the purposes of this subsection, the term "tax threshold" means the point at which a taxpayer begins to owe income tax after allowance of the standard deduction and all personal exemptions to which the taxpayer is entitled, but before application of any itemized deductions or credits. The credit shall be calculated in accordance with a table prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
