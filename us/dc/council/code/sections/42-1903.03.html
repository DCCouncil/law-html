                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Meetings of the unit owners’ association shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the condominium instruments at least once each year after the formation of the unit owners’ association and shall be open to all unit owners of record in good standing. The bylaws shall specify an officer who shall, at least 21 days in advance of any annual or regularly scheduled meeting, and at least 7 days in advance of any other meeting, send to each unit owner notice of time, place, and purposes of the meeting. Notice shall be sent by United States mail to all unit owners of record at the address of their respective units and to one other address as any of them may have designated in writing to the officer, or notice may be hand delivered by the officer; provided, that the officer certifies in writing that notice was hand delivered to the unit owner. Alternatively, notice may be sent by electronic means to any unit owner who requests delivery of notice in an electronic manner and who waives notice by mail or hand delivery, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Except as otherwise provided in the condominium instruments, all meetings of the unit owners’ association, committees of the unit owners’ association, and the executive board shall be open for observation to all unit owners in good standing. Minutes shall be recorded and shall be available for examination and copying by unit owners in good standing. This right of examination may be exercised:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Only during reasonable business hours or at a mutually convenient time and location; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Unless otherwise exempt as relating to an executive session pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection, at least one copy of the agenda furnished to members of the executive board for a meeting shall be made available for inspection by unit owners.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> Meetings of the executive board may be conducted or attended by telephone conference or video conference or similar electronic means. If a meeting is conducted by telephone conference, video conference, or similar electronic means, the equipment or system used must permit any executive board member in attendance to hear and be heard by, and to communicate what is said by all other executive board members participating in the meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(A)">(A)</span> The executive board, upon a motion and an affirmative vote in an open meeting to assemble in executive session, may convene in executive session to consider:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(A)(i)">(i)</span> Personnel matters relating to specific, identified persons who work for the unit owners’ association, including a person’s medical records;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(B)">(B)</span> For the purpose of subparagraph (A)(iii) of this paragraph, the term “anticipated litigation” means those instances where there has been a specific threat of litigation from a party or the legal counsel of a party.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The motion to assemble in executive session shall state specifically the purpose for the executive session. Reference to the motion and the stated purpose for the executive session shall be included in the minutes. The executive board shall restrict the consideration of matters during an executive session to those purposes specifically set forth in the motion. A motion passed, or other formal action taken, in an executive session shall be recorded in the minutes of the open meeting, but this shall not require disclosure of any details that are properly the subject of confidential consideration in an executive session. The action or actions authorized by a motion passed in an executive session shall be reflected in minutes available to unit owners in good standing. The requirements of this section shall not require the disclosure of information in violation of law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Subject to reasonable rules adopted by the executive board, the executive board shall provide a designated period of time during each regularly scheduled meeting to allow unit owners an opportunity to comment on any matter relating to the unit owners’ association.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The executive board may take action without a meeting by resolution issued with the unanimous written consent of the members of the executive board in support of the action being taken. A copy of the resolution shall be attached to the minutes of the next executive board meeting that occurs following its adoption.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Notwithstanding any language contained in the condominium instruments, the unit owners’ association may provide notice of a meeting or deliver information to a unit owner by electronic transmission if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The executive board authorizes the unit owners’ association to provide notice of a meeting or deliver information by electronic transmission;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> The inadvertent failure to deliver notice by electronic transmission shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Meetings of the unit owners' association, board of directors, or committees may be conducted or attended by telephone conference, video conference, or similar electronic means.
