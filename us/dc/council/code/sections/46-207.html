                  <p>“(c) For the purpose of this section, the IV-D agency shall be deemed to have received the holder’s address on the date the IV-D agency’s computerized support enforcement system receives notice of income or an income source from a court, a state, a holder, the Federal Parent Locator Service, or another source recognized by the IV-D agency, or the date information regarding a newly hired employee is entered into the District of Columbia Directory of New Hires pursuant to section 27f. The Court shall provide the IV-D agency with information it receives concerning the name or address of a holder within 2 business days after receiving the information.</p>
                  <p>“(d) The IV-D agency shall use the automated system it maintains pursuant to section 27j to the maximum extent that is feasible to assist and facilitate the collection and disbursement of support payments and the implementation of withholding, including:</p>
                  <p>“(1) Transmission of orders to withhold to employers and other holders;</p>
                  <p>“(2) Ongoing monitoring to promptly identify failures to make timely payment of support; and</p>

A person or entity serving a notice to withhold shall provide a copy of the support order and the order authorizing the withholding to the holder with the notice.</p>
                  <p>“(f) Notices and orders to withhold may be served without prior notice to the obligor, by in person delivery, certified mail, first-class mail, facsimile, or electronically, if the holder can receive electronic notices.”</p>
