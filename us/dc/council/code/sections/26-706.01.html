                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Any District bank that was in existence on December 18, 1985, and continuously operating for at least 2 years prior to that date; or</p>

The Superintendent [Commissioner] shall list applications for acquisition among the pending applications in the Superintendent’s [Commissioner’s] periodic bulletin, published in the District of Columbia Register, and mailed without charge to any person upon request. Prior to deciding whether to grant approval of the application, the Superintendent [Commissioner] shall accept public comment on the application and shall hold a public hearing on the application, according to procedures established by the rules issued by the Superintendent [Commissioner]. The Superintendent [Commissioner] shall not approve the acquisitions unless it is found that the application satisfies the requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/26-704" title="§ 26–704. Review of applications.">§ 26-704</a>, including the $4,000 application fee, and subsection (b) of this section.</p>

In no event shall the amount of loans and extension of credit be less than $50,000,000 or required to be made more than $100,000,000, though an applicant may agree to make loans and extend credit in target economic development projects in excess of $100,000,000, and the loans shall not include temporary financing, general obligation bonds issued by the District government, or the purchase of an interest in a pool of mortgage loans, such as mortgage participation certificates issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Government National Mortgage Association, or the Farmers Home Administration;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The applicant will establish at least 2 bank offices in target banking development areas, in addition to any acquired bank offices, within 3 years following the date of acquisition of a District bank or District bank holding company;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> The applicant will sell food coupons pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2011 et seq.;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> The applicant will employ at least 200 District residents, or a lesser number according to a sliding scale based upon total assets to be developed by the Superintendent [Commissioner], but in no event less than 50, in positions located in the District that were not located in the District prior to approval of the application, within 3 years following the date of acquisition of a District bank holding company or District bank; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The applicant will promote international trade and finance within the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> With its application, an applicant shall submit an irrevocable and confirmed letter of credit for $10,000,000 from an acceptable bank, as determined by the Superintendent [Commissioner].

In all events, at the end of 3 years following the acquisition of a District bank or a District bank holding company under this section, the Superintendent [Commissioner] shall review the activities of the nonregional bank holding company making the acquisition, and of its District bank subsidiaries, and shall determine whether the nonregional bank holding company has fulfilled, and is continuing to fulfill, the commitments set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The Superintendent [Commissioner] shall complete the review and make the determination no later than 3 years and 3 months after the acquisition of a District bank or bank holding company by the nonregional bank holding company.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> Upon the determination of the Superintendent [Commissioner] that a bank holding company has failed to comply with any commitment made in connection with an application filed pursuant to this section, the Superintendent [Commissioner] shall order the company to take steps to comply with the commitment within a specified reasonable period of time. The Superintendent [Commissioner] may extend this specified reasonable period of time.</p>
