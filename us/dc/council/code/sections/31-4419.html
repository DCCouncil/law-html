                <p>Any domestic stock company organized or licensed to do business, whether incorporated under this subdivision, or any previous existing law, or act of Congress, may become a mutual company, and to that end may carry out a plan for the acquisition of shares of its capital stock; provided, however, that such plan:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Shall have been adopted by a vote of a majority of the directors of such company;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Shall have been approved by a majority vote of the policyholders voting at a meeting, called for the purpose, of policyholders each insured for at least $1,000 and whose insurance shall then be in force and shall have been in force for at least 1 year prior to such meeting; notice of such meeting shall be given by mailing such notice from the home office of such corporation at least 30 days prior to such meeting, in a sealed envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to such policyholders at their last known post-office addresses, and such meeting shall be otherwise provided for and conducted in such manner as shall be provided in such plan; provided, however, that policyholders may vote in person, by proxy, or by mail; that all votes shall be cast by ballot and the Commissioner shall supervise and direct the methods and procedure of said meeting and appoint an adequate number of inspectors to conduct the voting at said meeting who shall have power to determine all questions concerning the verification of the ballots, the ascertainment of the validity thereof, the qualifications of the voters, and the canvass of the vote, and who shall certify to the Commissioner and to the company the result thereof, and with respect thereto shall act under such rules and regulations as shall be prescribed by the Council of the District of Columbia; that all necessary expenses incurred by the Commissioner shall be paid by the company as certified to by him; and</p>

                  <p>Department of Insurance abolished: See Historical and Statutory Notes following <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/31-4402" title="§ 31–4402. Formation — Filing, notice and bond requirements.">§ 31-4402</a>.</p>
                  <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                  <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(274) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11" title="§ 1–207.11. Abolishment of existing government and transfer of functions.">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14#(a)" title="">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
