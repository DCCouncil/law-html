If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment shall be a lien from the time the first installment becomes due and payable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The lien shall be prior to any other lien or encumbrance except:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(C)">(C)</span> A lien for real estate taxes or municipal assessments or charges against the unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The lien shall also be prior to a mortgage or deed of trust described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection and recorded after March 7, 1991, to the extent of the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the unit owners’ association which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the 6 months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien or recordation of a memorandum of lien against the title to the unit by the unit owners' association. The provisions of this subsection shall not affect the priority of mechanics’ or materialmen’s lien.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The recording of the condominium instruments pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall constitute record notice of the existence of such lien and no further recordation of any claim of lien for assessment shall be required.</p>

Any language contained in the condominium instruments that authorizes specific procedures by which a unit owners’ association may recover sums for which subsection (a) of this section creates a lien, shall not be construed to prohibit a unit owners’ association from foreclosing on a unit by the power of sale procedures set forth in this section unless the power of sale procedures are specifically and expressly prohibited by the condominium instruments.</p>
