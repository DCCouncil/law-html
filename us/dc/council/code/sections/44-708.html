Principal repayment during the first 60 months of operation may be deferred with payment reauthorized over the remaining 15 years. Interest rate charged shall be comparable to the rate of interest on a 20 year treasury note, adjusted to provide for appropriate administrative charges.</p>
                  <p>“ Sec. 6. Assistance in medically underserved areas for public use. All loans made by the Mayor and all money expended by the Mayor in connection with the exercise of any power granted pursuant to this act are exercised for a public use.”</p>

                  <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                  <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11" title="§ 1–207.11. Abolishment of existing government and transfer of functions.">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14#(a)" title="">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
