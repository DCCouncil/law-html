                  <p>“(9) An analysis of whether CTE programs should receive additional flexibility in determining, in conjunction with their relevant industry councils, appropriate guidelines for hiring, scheduling, assessing, and compensating CTE faculty in accordance with federal and local law and collective bargaining agreements, and, if so, a process for granting and administering such flexibility;</p>
                  <p>“(10) A strategy to support and incentivize CTE programs to provide night or weekend CTE course offerings to adult District residents; and</p>

                  <p>“(f)(1) The city-wide strategic plan shall be submitted to the Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess.

                  <p>“(2) If the plan is disapproved by the Council, the Council’s Committee of the Whole shall transmit a report to the CTE Task Force citing the Council’s concerns within 30 days of the disapproval and the CTE Task Force shall have 30 days from the date it received the report to review the report and re-submit a new plan to the Mayor and the Council for approval in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.”</p>
                  <p>Section 5(b) of D.C. Law 19-199 provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
