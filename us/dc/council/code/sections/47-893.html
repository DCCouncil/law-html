Interests in real property belonging to government and international organizations.">§ 47-1005.01</a> because of a ground lease and the improvement is privately owned, the interest in or use of the land and the improvement shall be subject to the special assessment imposed by this subchapter based on the land area of the interest and the actual gross building area of the improvement (if not subject to District zoning) or the gross building area of the improvement (if subject to District zoning); provided further, that if the real property becomes owned by an entity other than the District of Columbia, the United States, or the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the provisions of this paragraph shall not exempt the real property from the special assessment imposed by this subchapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Real properties on which, on June 1, 2007, occupied residential were located; provided, that after June 1, 2007, if the real property is redeveloped for nonresidential uses, or if the real property becomes part of a development project that may include a condominium regime, that consists of 5 or more dwelling units, the provisions of this paragraph shall not exempt the real property or subdivisions thereof from the special assessment imposed by this subchapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Real properties on which, on June 1, 2007, an active house of worship with a tax-exempt status was located; provided, that after June 1, 2007, if the real property is later used for a purpose other than as a house of worship, the provisions of this paragraph shall not exempt the real property from the special assessment imposed by this subchapter; or</p>

The notice shall state the amount of the proposed special assessment and the procedure for appeal set forth in subsection (e) of this section. The Chief Financial Officer shall not recalculate either factor because an additional real property has become subject to the special assessment after the first determination under this paragraph. No further notice shall be required for future tax years.</p>
