                  <p>“Sec. 2. Establishment of Workforce Intermediary Task Force.</p>
                  <p>“(a)(1) By November 1, 2011, the Mayor shall establish a Workforce Intermediary Task Force (”Task Force“) to review best practices for workforce intermediary programs.</p>

                  <p>“(2) If the recommendations are disapproved by the Council, the Council’s Committee on Housing and Workforce Development shall transmit a report to the Task Force citing the Council’s concerns and the Task Force shall have 30 days to review the report and re-submit its new recommendations to the Mayor and the Council for approval pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

                  <p>“(7) Two members of the District business community who represent industries that are frequently subject to first source agreements, appointed by the Mayor;</p>
                  <p>“(8) Two members of the District business community who represent industries that are frequently subject to first source agreements, appointed by the Chairman of the Council;</p>
                  <p>“(9) A representative of a District job training or education provider, appointed by the Mayor;</p>
