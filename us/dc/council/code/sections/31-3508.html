In such event the waiting period shall be suspended and shall recommence as of the date the information is furnished. Upon written application by the corporation, the Mayor may authorize a filing which the Mayor has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension thereof, or at any later date.

If not disapproved before the expiration of the review period or any extension thereof requested by the corporation, the filing shall be deemed approved. Any disapproval under this subsection shall be applied retrospectively to the date the corporation made such rates effective.

Any subscriber contract forms and rates previously approved by the Mayor, but subsequently disapproved under this section, shall be considered disapproved on a prospective basis only from the date of such notice of disapproval, unless the corporation made a material misrepresentation in its contract form or rate filings.</p>

The order shall not affect any subscriber contract, group certificate, or other contract made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.

In establishing the rates to be charged individuals with open enrollment subscriber contracts, including individual conversion subscriber contracts, the revenue which would have been otherwise collected by the District of Columbia government through the imposition of the 1% premium tax pursuant to § 31-3514(j), but which a corporation has contributed to a Rate Stabilization Fund in accordance with § 31-3514(j)(1), shall be credited by the corporation to the benefit of this class of subscribers in an amount which assures competitive rates.</p>
