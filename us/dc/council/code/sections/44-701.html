Notice of the receiver’s petition to the court for permission to borrow must be given to the owner, the licensee, and the Mayor.</p>
                  <p>“(B) The court, after a hearing, may authorize the receiver to borrow money upon specified terms of repayment and pledge security, if necessary, if the court determines:</p>
                  <p>“(i) That the hospital should not be closed and that the loan is reasonably necessary to prevent or remove jeopardy; or</p>
                  <p>“(ii) That the hospital should be closed and that the loan is necessary to prevent or remove jeopardy to patients for the limited period of time they are awaiting transfer to another hospital or other facility.</p>
                  <p>“(g) A receiver may not close a hospital without leave of the court. In ruling on the issue of closure, the court shall consider:</p>
                  <p>“(1) The rights and best interests of the patients;</p>
                  <p>“(2) The availability of suitable alternative placements;</p>
                  <p>“(3) The rights, interests, and obligations of the owner and licensee;</p>
                  <p>“(4) The licensure status of the hospital; and</p>
                  <p>“(5) Any other factors the court considers relevant.</p>
                  <p>“(h) The owner and the licensee shall be divested of possession and control of the hospital during the period of receivership, under the conditions the court specifies.</p>
                  <p>“(i) An order appointing a receiver pursuant to this section shall have the effect of a license of operation for the duration of the receivership. The receiver shall be responsible to the court for the conduct of the hospital during the receivership, and a violation of regulations governing the conduct of the hospital, if not promptly corrected, shall be reported to the court.</p>
                  <p>“(j)(1) The court shall review the continued necessity of a receivership at least semiannually.</p>
                  <p>“(2) The court shall terminate a receivership when it certifies that the conditions that prompted the receivership have been corrected or, in the case of a discontinuance of operation, when the patients have been safely relocated.</p>
                  <p>“(3) The court shall not terminate a receivership in favor of the former licensee or of a new licensee, unless the person, or entity, assumes all obligations incurred by the receiver and provides collateral or other assurances of payment considered sufficient by the court.</p>
                  <p>“(k) No person may bring suit against a receiver appointed pursuant to this section without first securing leave of the court. Except in cases of gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing, a receiver shall be liable only for actions taken in his or her official capacity and any adverse judgment shall be satisfied out of receivership assets.</p>
                  <p>“(l) The District of Columbia shall not be liable for repayment of funds borrowed by a receiver during the course of the receivership or responsible for any financial obligations of the hospital.</p>
                  <p>“Sec. 6. First source employment agreement. ”The United Medical Center shall enter into a first source employment agreement with the Department of Employment Services with respect to the funds authorized in this act.”</p>
                  <p>Section 8(b) of D.C. Law 18-154 provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
