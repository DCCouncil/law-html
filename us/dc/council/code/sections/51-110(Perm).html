                  <p>“(i) The training prepares the claimant for entry into a high-demand occupation (if the Director determines that the claimant has been separated from employment in a declining occupation or has been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the claimant’s place of unemployment);</p>
                  <p>“(ii) The claimant is making satisfactory progress towards completing the training as determined by the Director, including the submission of written statements from the training program provider; and</p>

The stipends for non-training cost allowances shall be treated as ‘earnings’ as defined in this act.</p>
                  <p>“(2) A claimant who is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection shall be enrolled in training and making satisfactory progress as the Director may determine will increase the employability of the claimant in the District labor market.</p>
                  <p>“(3) The weekly training extension benefit amount payable pursuant to this act shall be equal to the claimant’s weekly benefit amount for the most recent benefit year less any deductible income as determined by this act. The total amount of training extension benefits payable to a claimant shall not exceed 26 times the claimant’s weekly benefit amount of the most recent benefit year.</p>
                  <p>“(4) If the claimant completes the training program, ceases to be making satisfactory progress, or stops attending the training program, the claimant shall not be eligible for further training extension benefits unless the Director determines that the claimant has resolved the impediment.</p>
                  <p>“(5) A claimant seeking training extension benefits may apply for the benefits at any time prior to the end of the claimant’s initial benefit year or the end of any period of extended benefits.</p>
