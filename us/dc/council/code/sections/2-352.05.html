                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The economic advantage of the privatization contract shall not be outweighed by the public's interest in having a particular function performed directly by District employees, as demonstrated in the determination and findings issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> The privatization contract shall be awarded through a publicized, competitive procurement process pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/3A/subchapters/IV" title="Subchapter IV.
