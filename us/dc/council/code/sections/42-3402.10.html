                  <p>Reenactment of Law 3-86: See Historical and Statutory Notes following <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/42-3401.01" title="§ 42–3401.01. Findings.">§ 42-3401.01</a>.</p>
                  <p>Amendment of section by Law 10-144: Section 2(g) of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/laws/10-144" title="D.C. Law 10-144. Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act of 1980 Extension and Amendment Act of 1994.">D.C. Law 10-144</a> purported to amend this section to read as follows: “This subchapter shall remain in effect until the Mayor declares that a housing crisis no longer exists pursuant to § 45-1662. The rights granted under § 45-1616 to eligible elderly tenants may not be abrogated or reduced notwithstanding such a declaration by the Mayor. The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to the conversion of housing accommodations into condominium or cooperative status which are fully vacant as of the date of application to the Mayor for a vacancy exemption. Occupancy by 1 or more employees or other occupants for security or similar nontenancy purposes shall not prevent the accommodation from qualifying for a vacancy exemption. The owner shall submit to the Mayor an application for vacancy exemption in order to qualify for this vacancy exemption. The application shall require that the owner certify that the owner is not an owner or purchaser as described in the third sentence of § 45-1611(a)(2) and that the owner has affirmatively sought information from any applicable former owner in order to make a truthful certification. The Mayor shall accept the owner’s certification unless the Mayor has received information which tends to challenge the truthfulness of the certification.”</p>
