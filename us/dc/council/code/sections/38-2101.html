                <p>The Mayor of the District of Columbia is authorized to enter into and execute on behalf of the District of Columbia an agreement with any state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
                <p>
                  <center>THE INTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON QUALIFICATION OF EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL</center>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-heading">Article</span> <span class="level-num" id="I">I</span> <span class="level-heading">Purpose, Findings, and Policy</span></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="I1.">1.</span> The States party to this Agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the States party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="I2.">2.</span> The party States find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the Nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other States. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their States of origin, can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this Agreement can increase the availability of educational manpower.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="II4.">4.</span> “State” means a State, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="II5.">5.</span> “Originating State” means a State (and the subdivision thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="II6.">6.</span> “Receiving State” means a State (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.</p>

A designated State official may enter into a contract pursuant to this Article only with States in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in his own State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="III2.">2.</span> Any such contract shall provide for:</p>

No contract made pursuant to this Agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving State of any person qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="III5.">5.</span> The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated. However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving State.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="III6.">6.</span> A contract committee composed of the designated State officials of the contracting States or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting States.</p>

                  <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                  <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11" title="§ 1–207.11. Abolishment of existing government and transfer of functions.">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14#(a)" title="">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
