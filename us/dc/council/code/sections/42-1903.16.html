                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(B)">(B)</span> If prior to the conveyance of the first residential unit to a purchaser, the declarant has not posted warranty security as required by sub-paragraph (A) of this paragraph, the escrow agency for the sale of the residential unit shall collect the warranty security payment prior to closing and submit the warranty security payment to the Mayor on the settlement date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(C)">(C)</span> The bond, letter of credit, or other security shall be in a form that is automatically renewable and may only expire with permission by the Mayor, unless a release or approval of revocation is granted by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(D)">(D)</span> The amount of the warranty security shall be based on the estimated hard construction and conversion costs, including labor and materials, at the time of filing the application for condominium registration. These costs shall be determined according to industry standards for estimating construction costs. If the actual hard construction and conversion costs, including labor and materials, as of the time of substantial completion of the condominium, as certified by the project architect, exceeds the previously estimated costs by more than 10%, the declarant shall post an additional warranty security in the amount of 20% of the difference between the estimated hard construction and conversion costs, including labor and materials, and the actual hard construction and conversion costs, including labor and materials, as of project substantial completion, as certified by the project architect.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(E)">(E)</span> No condominium unit shall be conveyed to a purchaser until the warranty security has been posted in accordance with requirements set forth in this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> To support the amount of the warranty security posted by the declarant, a declarant shall provide a sworn statement attesting to cost estimates for the conversion construction work proposed, including the costs of materials and labor at the time of filing the application for condominium registration, and at the time of substantial completion of the condominium, as certified by the project architect, if the costs have exceeded the estimates as set forth in paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Pro rata segments shall be based on the residential unit's percentage interest in the residential portion of the condominium.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> At the end of 5 years after the conveyance of the first residential unit to a purchaser, the declarant may sell unsold residential units as resale units, in which event no warranty against structural defects in the units under this section shall be required and the bond shall be reduced pro rata as to those unsold units; provided, that one year has passed following transfer of control by the declarant.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(6)(B)">(B)</span> After 30 calendar days after the date the declarant receives the claimant's notice of intent to file a claim, the claimant may file a claim of structural defect to a residential unit or portion of the common elements with the Mayor on a form prescribed by the Mayor. The claimant shall send a copy of the claim to the declarant via certified mail and return receipt requested on the same date the claimant files a claim with the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(6)(C)">(C)</span> A declarant shall file with the Mayor a written response to a structural defect claim filed with the Mayor within 30 calendar days of receipt of a copy of the claim.

Any award from the warranty security posted by the declarant shall be suspended pending the issuance of an order from OAH, in which case the decision of the OAH shall supersede any decision by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(6)(H)">(H)</span> If a unit owners association or unit owner files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction for a breach of the warranties created by this section, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs as may be determined by the court.

                  <p><a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/laws/13-46" title="D.C. Law 13-46. Condominium Amendment Act of 1999.">D.C. Law 13-46</a> added subsecs. (f) and (g) and rewrote subsec. (e) which formerly provided:</p>
                  <p>“(e)(1) Prior to the declarant’s first conveyance of a residential unit to a purchaser, the declarant shall post a bond or letter of credit with the Mayor in the amount of 10% of the estimated construction or conversion costs, or shall provide any other form of security the Mayor shall approve to satisfy any costs that arise from the declarant’s failure to satisfy the requirements of this section. The other security may include a lien in favor of the Mayor against the declarant’s equity in any unsold units, including any non-residential units, in which event the unsold units will be valued, for purposes of computing the declarant’s equity, at 90% of the current listed sales price of the units, or if not listed, then the current listed sales price of comparable units in the condominium. The bond, letter of credit, or other security shall be reduced at the declarant’s request in pro rata segments (based on the residential unit’s percentage interest in the residential portion of the condominium) 2 years after the conveyance of each unit; provided, however, that in no event shall the security be reduced below 50% of the original amount of the security until one year after transfer of control of the residential executive board of the condominium association to purchasing residential unit owners other than the declarant. For purposes of this subsection, ’transfer of control’ shall have occurred when 51% or more of the residential executive board is composed of residential unit owners other than the declarant, or successor declarant, or the declarant’s selections or nominees. At the end of 5 years from the conveyance of the first residential unit to a purchaser, and provided one year has passed following transfer of control by the declarant, the declarant may sell unsold residential units as resale units, in which event no warranty against structural defects in the units under this section shall be required and the bond shall be reduced pro rata as to those unsold units. The bonding requirements pursuant to this subsection and the warranties required under this section are applicable only to residential condominiums or the residential condominium portion of mixed use condominiums or mixed use projects. If residential condominium units are part of a mixed use condominium, the cost of the residential portion of the condominium shall include the residential condominium units’ pro rata share of common elements, based on the residential condominium units’ percentage interest in the common elements. If a residential condominium is part of a mixed use project, the cost of the residential condominium includes its pro rata share of those portions of the project directly supporting, enclosing or servicing the residential condominium.</p>
                  <p>“(2) If claims for structural defects under this section are pending at the time the bond or other security posted would otherwise no longer be required, then the bond or other security shall be required to be maintained in the amount of the claim, until the claims have been finally resolved and the bond or other security has been made available to satisfy the declarant’s responsibilities to the unit owners and association under this section. The bylaws and other condominium documents to be prepared by the declarant shall not restrict or hinder the residential executive board’s right to assert claims under this section.”</p>
