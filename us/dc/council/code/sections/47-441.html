                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="VIII2.">2.</span> Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records, or other documents, may request the Commission to perform the audit on its behalf. In responding to the request, the Commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The Commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit. The Commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="VIII3.">3.</span> The Commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, documents, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit. If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the Commission within the state of which he is a resident; provided, that such state has adopted this article.</p>

The Commission may apply for such order to the courts of the state or subdivision thereof, other than the District of Columbia, on behalf of which the audit is being made, or in which the party or subject matter being sought is situated, to the extent that the Commission is authorized to do so by the laws of such other state. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="VIII5.">5.</span> The Commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the Commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="VIII6.">6.</span> Information obtained by an audit pursuant to this article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions, or the United States.
