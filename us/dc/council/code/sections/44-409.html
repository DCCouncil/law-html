The application shall be considered complete upon the SHPDA’s receipt of the applicant’s response to any such request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The SHPDA shall issue its determination on an application for a certificate of need within 90 days after the date that the review process begins. If the SHPDA cannot issue its determination within that period, the review period may be extended for one additional period of 30 days.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The SHPDA shall provide the applicant, the SHCC, and all previously appearing parties with a detailed explanation of any decision.</p>

The SHPDA is authorized to charge reasonable fees for the costs of providing to the public documents covered under this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> In issuing a certificate of need, the SHPDA shall specify in the certificate the maximum amount of capital expenditures which may be obligated under the certificate. The SHPDA shall prescribe the extent to which a project authorized by a certificate of need shall be subject to further review if the amount of capital expenditures obligated or expected to be obligated for the project exceeds the maximum specified in the certificate of need.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The SHPDA may impose a condition upon the grant of a certificate of need if it is necessary to meet a criterion or standard previously adopted and published by the SHPDA. The SHPDA shall modify or remove a condition upon application at any time by the holder of the certificate of need or other person if the circumstances upon which the condition is premised change and no longer justify the condition, or if the condition, for any other reason, is no longer appropriate.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> SHPDA shall require that all prospective certificate of need applicants certify, in writing, that for the five-year period following the award of the certificate of need the percentage of uncompensated care (charity and bad-debt) provided each year to the population served by the HCF will be equal to or exceed the average of the percentage of uncompensated care provided by the HCF for the 2 fiscal years immediately preceding the review of an application for a certificate of need pursuant to this section.</p>

Law 15-149</a>, in subsec. (c), inserted “for expedited administrative review,” following “renewal applications,”, and deleted the last sentence which read: “The SHPDA develop special review procedures for proposed capital expenditures not directly related to patient care but which will increase the cost of patient care by more than 1%.”; rewrote subsec. (d)(2); in subsec. (e), deleted “which contradicts the recommendation of the SHCC” following “any decision”; and, in subsec. (f), added a new sentence which read; “The SHPDA is authorized to charge reasonable fees for the costs of providing to the public documents covered under this subsection.” Prior to amendment, subsec.
