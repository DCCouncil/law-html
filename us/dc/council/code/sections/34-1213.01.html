(d) The city negotiating team has completed its mandate and has successfully negotiated the final terms of a proposed franchise agreement with the Grantee, the terms of which have been reviewed by the Council and are approved. Sec. 3. Grant of the Franchise. Pursuant to Section 14a(a) of the Cable Television Communications Act of 1981, effective October 22, 1983 (<a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/laws/4-142" title="D.C. Law 4-142.">D.C.
