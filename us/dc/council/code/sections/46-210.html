                  <p>“Sec. 11. Objections to withholding.</p>
                  <p>“(a) An obligor may object to a withholding commenced pursuant to section 8a by filing a motion to quash the withholding with the Court within 15 days after the earlier of the date the notice of withholding was mailed or the date the first payment was withheld.</p>
                  <p>“(b) The Court shall resolve any motion to quash the withholding within 90 days after service of the motion on the opposing party, unless, upon a showing of good cause, the Court finds that additional time is needed to resolve the motion.</p>
                  <p>“(c) The only ground for an objection to a withholding is a mistake of fact, which is defined as:</p>
                  <p>“(1) A mistake in the amount of arrears;</p>
                  <p>“(2) A mistake in the identity of the obligor; or</p>
                  <p>“(3) A mistake in the amount of the withholding that causes the amount withheld to exceed the limits specified in section 9 or section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, approved May 29, 1968 (82 Stat. 163;  15 U.S.C. § 1673(b)).</p>
                  <p>“(d) Payment of arrearages after the date of issuance of a notice of withholding to the obligor pursuant to section 10 is not a defense to the withholding.</p>
                  <p>“(e) The Court shall deny the motion in all cases except where the identity of the obligor is mistaken or, if applicable, where arrearages have never equaled one month of support payments, and shall notify the obligor.</p>
                  <p>“(f) If the Court determines that the amount to be withheld exceeds the limits of section 9 or section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Court shall serve or direct the IV-D agency to serve an order to withhold on the holder that complies with those limits.</p>
                  <p>“(g) The Court shall deny any request to stay the withholding pending resolution of an objection or appeal.”</p>
                  <p>Section 5(b) of D.C. Law 16-42 provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
