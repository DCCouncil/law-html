                  <p>“(C) Income from a business conducted wholly by the taxpayer member entirely within the District;</p>
                  <p>“(D) Income sourced to the District from the sale or exchange of capital or assets, and from involuntary conversions, as determined under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/47-1810.05#(b)(8)" title="">§ 47-1810.05(b)(8)</a>;</p>
                  <p>“(E) Nonbusiness income or loss allocable to the District as determined under the provisions for allocation of nonbusiness income set forth in this chapter;</p>
                  <p>“(F) Income or loss allocated or apportioned in an earlier year required to be taken into account as District source income during the income year, other than a net operating loss; and</p>
                  <p>“(G) Net operating loss carryover.</p>

Determination of the business income of the combined group.">§ 47-1810.05</a> results in a loss for a taxpayer member of the combined group, that taxpayer member has a District net operating loss, subject to the net operating loss limitations and carryover provisions of this chapter. The District net operating loss shall be applied as a deduction in the subsequent year only if that taxpayer has District source positive net income, whether or not the taxpayer is a member of a combined reporting group in the subsequent year.</p>
                  <p>“(3) Except where otherwise provided, no tax credit or post-apportionment deduction earned by one member of the group, but not fully used by or allowed to that member, may be used, in whole or in part, by another member of the group or applied, in whole or in part, against the total income of the combined group. A post-apportionment deduction carried over into a subsequent year as to the member that incurred it, and available as a deduction to that member in a subsequent year, will be considered in the computation of the income of that member in the subsequent year regardless of the composition of that income as apportioned, allocated, or wholly within the District.</p>

                  <p>“(A) Business income of the combined group, determined under § 47- 1810.05; and</p>
                  <p>“(B) Taxpayer member’s apportionment percentage, determined in accordance with this chapter, including in the property, payroll, and sales factor numerators of the taxpayer’s property, payroll, and sales, respectively, associated with the combined group’s unitary business in the District and including in the denominator the property, payroll, and sales of all members of the combined group, including the taxpayer, which property, payroll, and sales are associated with the combined group’s unitary business wherever located.</p>
                  <p>“(2) If any member owns an interest in a partnership that is not an unincorporated business, as defined by <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/47-1808.01" title="§ 47–1808.01. Tax on unincorporated businesses — Definition.">§ 47-1808.01</a>, the income or loss of such partnership shall be apportioned to the District using the apportionment factor of the partnership, and the combined group member-partner’s distributive share of such income shall be added to the combined group member-partner’s income.”</p>
