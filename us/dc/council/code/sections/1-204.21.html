Such rate of compensation may be increased or decreased by act of the Council. Such change in such compensation, upon enactment by the Council in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, shall apply with respect to the term of Mayor next beginning after the date of such change. In addition, the Mayor may receive an allowance, in such amount as the Council may from time to time establish, for official, reception, and representation expenses, which he shall certify in reasonable detail to the Council.</p>
