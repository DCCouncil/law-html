                  <h4>Temporary Legislation</h4>
                  <p>Section 2 of D.C. Law 19-203 created the Public Schools Revenue Generation Fund as follows:</p>
                  <p>“There is established as a nonlapsing fund the Public Schools Revenue Generation Fund (‘Fund’), which shall be used solely as provided in subsection (d) of this section and administered by the District of Columbia Public Schools (‘DCPS’). The Fund shall be funded by annual appropriations, which shall be deposited into the Fund.”</p>
                  <p>“(b) All funds deposited into the Fund, and any interest earned on those funds, shall not revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in subsection (d) of this section without regard to fiscal year limitation, subject to authorization by Congress.</p>
                  <p>“(c) Funds deposited into the Fund shall include:</p>
                  <p>“(1) The sale of tickets to sporting events and school performances (‘Ticket Sales’); and</p>
                  <p>“(2) School facility use agreement and permit fees pursuant to this act (‘Use Agreements’).</p>
                  <p>“(d) The Fund shall be used to support the administration, improvement, and maintenance of property and programs managed by DCPS to supplement, but not replace, services provided by DCPS.</p>
                  <p>“(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, DCPS may contract for, pursuant to all applicable contracting and procurement guidelines, Ticket Sales and Use Agreements.</p>
                  <p>“(f) The Mayor, pursuant to Title 1 of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act, approved October 21, 1968 (82 Stat. 1204; D.C.

The proposed rules shall be submitted to the Council for a 30-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed rules, by resolution, within the 30-day review period, the proposed rules shall be deemed approved.”</p>
                  <p>Section 4(b) of D.C. Law 19-203 provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p>Establishment of District of Columbia Advisory Committee on Education: See Mayor’s Order 89-256, November 7, 1989.</p>
                  <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                  <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11" title="§ 1–207.11. Abolishment of existing government and transfer of functions.">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14#(a)" title="">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
