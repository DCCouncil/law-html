                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan presented by the Developer can be used as a model for developing large tracts of underutilized land to create workforce housing, needed community facilities and services, and jobs, and to increase the District’s tax base.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> While the Market has an active retail and wholesale business of local, national, and international food and meat products, the Market now is an underutilized resource of its neighborhood and the city.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The Market’s present condition, uses, and zoning substantially impair the sound growth of an underutilized site near a metrorail station and prevent the development of new housing and much needed workforce housing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> The Market is an ideal site for transit-oriented development that will increase pedestrian-friendly residential density adjacent to transit facilities that is consistent with the District’s goals of maximizing transit usage while reducing automobile dependency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The New Town at the Capital City Market Project will accomplish neighborhood revitalization and historic preservation and provide workforce housing and jobs.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan will allow the present retailers and wholesalers to continue their businesses in the new revitalized Capital City Market.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan will be carried out in such a way that it will cause minimal interference to the existing operators of retail and wholesale establishments and allow them to continue to operate during construction.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(q)">(q)</span> The construction of the project will take more than 5 years, which will allow District residents to be trained as apprentices for jobs created by the development and become full-fledged journeyman on the project.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(r)">(r)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan provides for a workforce housing set-aside of a minimum of 20% and a goal of 40%, which will have a significant impact on increasing the District’s workforce housing supply by approximately 320 or 640 units, respectively.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(s)">(s)</span> The Mayor is authorized to negotiate a land swap or sale with Gallaudet University and to use other means, such as property tax abatement, tax increment financing, and PILOT programs, to assist the Developer in achieving the 40% goal of workforce housing and other community needs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(t)">(t)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan calls for 40% of the workforce housing to be set aside for teachers, policemen, firemen, and other critical District of Columbia employees and the remaining 60% to be set-aside for District of Columbia residents who are first-time home purchasers and are at 50% to 120% of the Area Median Income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(u)">(u)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan will relocate the retail and wholesale operations of the existing Market into modern facilities in the northeast portion of the site which will allow for convenient ingress and egress access for large trailer trucks to and from New York Avenue and Florida Avenue while screening them from residential areas and pedestrian traffic.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(v)">(v)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan provides that the new facilities for the existing retail and wholesale operations will be constructed as condominiums or cooperatives to allow the retailers and wholesalers to own their retail or wholesale facilities.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(x)">(x)</span> The Revitalization and Development Plan provides that the YMCA, library, and community health clinic will all operate on a 20-year lease-to-purchase agreement with ownership transferring to the leaseholders for $1 at lease expiration.</p>
