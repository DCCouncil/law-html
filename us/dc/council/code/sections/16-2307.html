                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> the child was fifteen or more years of age at the time of the conduct charged, and is alleged to have committed an act which would constitute a felony if committed by an adult;</p>

For the purposes of this paragraph “playground” means any facility intended for recreation, open to the public, and with any portion of the facility that contains 1 or more separate apparatus intended for the recreation of children, including, but not limited to, sliding boards, swingsets, and teeterboards. For the purposes of this paragraph “video arcade” means any facility legally accessible to persons under 18 years of age, intended primarily for the use of pinball and video machines for amusement, and which contains a minimum of 10 pinball or video machines. For the purposes of this paragraph “youth center” means any recreational facility or gymnasium (including any parking lot appurtenant thereto), intended primarily for use by persons under 18 years of age, which regularly provide athletic, civic, or cultural activities.</p>

Evaluation and Treatment of Incompetent Defendants.">Chapter 5A of Title 24</a> [<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/dc/council/code/sections/24-531.01" title="§ 24–531.01.

The hearing shall be held within 30 days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays) after the filing of the transfer motion. Upon motion of the child or the Corporation Counsel, for good cause shown, the hearing may be continued for an additional period not to exceed 30 days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays). If the hearing commences more than 60 days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays) after the filing of the transfer motion, the Division must state in the order the extraordinary circumstances for the delay.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(B)">(B)</span> A statement of the Division’s reasons for ordering the transfer shall accompany the transfer order. The Division’s findings with respect to each of the factors set forth in subsection (e) of this section relating to the public welfare and protection of the public security shall be included in the statement. The statement shall be available upon request to any court in which the transfer is challenged, but shall not be available to the trier of fact of the criminal charge prior to verdict.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Evidence of the following factors shall be considered in determining whether there are reasonable prospects for rehabilitating a child prior to his majority and whether it is in the interest of the public welfare to transfer for criminal prosecution:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> the child’s age;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> the nature of the present offense and the extent and nature of the child’s prior delinquency record;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> the child’s mental condition;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> the child’s response to past treatment efforts including whether the child has absconded from the legal custody of the Mayor or a juvenile institution;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> the techniques, facilities, and personnel for rehabilitation available to the Division and to the court that would have jurisdiction after transfer; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(6)">(6)</span> The potential rehabilitative effect on the child of providing parenting classes or family counseling for one or more members of the child’s family or for the child’s caregiver or guardian.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e-1)">(e-1)</span> For purposes of the transfer hearing the Division shall assume that the child committed the delinquent act alleged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e-2)">(e-2)</span> There is a rebuttable presumption that a child 15 through 18 years of age who has been charged with any of the following offenses, should be transferred for criminal prosecution in the interest of public welfare and the protection of the public security:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e-2)(1)">(1)</span> Murder, first degree sexual abuse, burglary in the first degree, robbery while armed, or assault with intent to commit any such offense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e-2)(2)">(2)</span> Any offense listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection and any other offense properly joinable with such an offense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e-2)(3)">(3)</span> Any crime committed with a firearm; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e-2)(4)">(4)</span> Any offense that if the child were charged as an adult would constitute a violent felony and the child has three or more prior delinquency adjudications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Prior to a transfer hearing, a study and report, in writing, relevant to the factors in subsection (e), shall be made by the Director of Social Services. This report and all social records that are to be made available to the judge at the transfer hearing shall be made available to counsel for the child and to the Corporation Counsel at least three days prior to the hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> A judge who conducts a hearing pursuant to this section shall not, over the objection of the child for whom a motion to transfer was filed, participate in any subsequent factfinding proceedings relating to the offense.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> Transfer of a child for criminal prosecution terminates the jurisdiction of the Division over the child with respect to any subsequent delinquent act; except that jurisdiction of the Division over the child is restored if (1) the criminal prosecution is terminated other than by a plea of guilty, a verdict of guilty, or a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, and (2) at the time of the termination of the criminal prosecution no indictment or information has been filed for criminal prosecution for an offense alleged to have been committed by the child subsequent to transfer.</p>

                  <p><a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/laws/15-261" title="D.C. Law 15-261. Omnibus Juvenile Justice Act of 2004.">D.C. Law 15-261</a> rewrote subsecs. (c) and (d) which had read:</p>
                  <p>“(c) When there are grounds to believe the child is substantially retarded or mentally ill, the Division shall stay the proceedings for the purpose of obtaining an examination. After examination, the Division shall proceed to a determination under subsection (d) of this section unless it determines that the child is incompetent to participate in the proceedings, in which event it shall order the child committed to a mental hospital pursuant to  section 16-2315 or  section 24-501(a).</p>
                  <p>“(d) Unless a commitment under subsection (c) of this section has intervened, the Division shall conduct a hearing on each transfer motion to determine whether to transfer the child for criminal prosecution. This hearing shall be held within ten days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays) of the filing of the transfer motion. The Division shall order the transfer if it determines that it is in the interest of the public welfare and protection of the public security and there are no reasonable prospects for rehabilitation. A statement of the Division’s reasons for ordering the transfer shall accompany the transfer order. The Division’s findings with respect to each of the factors set forth in subsection (e) of this section relating to the public welfare and protection of the public security shall be included in the statement. This statement shall be available upon request to any court in which the transfer is challenged, but shall not be available to the trier of fact of the criminal charge prior to verdict.”</p>
                  <p>Law 15-358, in subsec. (c), substituted “<a class="internal-link " href="/us/dc/council/code/titles/24/chapters/5A" title="Chapter 5A. Evaluation and Treatment of Incompetent Defendants.">Chapter 5A of Title 24</a>” for “ section 24-501”.</p>
