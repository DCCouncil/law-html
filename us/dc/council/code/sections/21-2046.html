                  <p>“(A) Upon determination of continued incapacity and determination of a continued need for the provision of substituted consent for any health-care service, treatment, or procedure pursuant to  section 21-2210; or</p>
                  <p>“(B) If a petition for a permanent limited guardian or general guardian, pursuant to  section 21-2041, has been filed with the court prior to the expiration of the appointment of the temporary guardian.</p>
                  <p>“(d) If the court finds that any appointed guardian is not effectively performing duties and that the welfare of the ward requires immediate action, it may appoint, with notice to interested parties within 14 day after the appointment, a provisional guardian. The provisional guardian shall have the powers set forth in the previous order of appointment for a specified period not to exceed 6 months. The authority of any permanent guardian previously appointed by the court is suspended as long as a provisional guardian has authority.”</p>
