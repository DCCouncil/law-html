The provisions of this section shall apply for the purposes of determining minimum required distributions under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this subchapter; provided, that these provisions are intended solely to reflect the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and accompanying Treasury regulations and are not intended to provide or expand, and shall not be construed as providing or expanding, a benefit or distribution option not otherwise expressly provided for under the terms of this subchapter. The provisions of this section shall apply only to the extent required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as applied to a governmental plan, and if special rules for governmental plans are not set forth herein, the special rules are incorporated by reference and shall for all purposes be deemed a part of this subchapter.</p>

For the purposes of this paragraph and subsection (d) of this section, distributions are considered to begin on the member’s required beginning date or, if this subparagraph applies, the date distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. If annuity payments to the member irrevocably commence before the member’s required beginning date or to the member’s surviving spouse before the date distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.</p>

The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received (for example, bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually). All of the member’s benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year shall be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member’s required beginning date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> Additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year shall be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.</p>
